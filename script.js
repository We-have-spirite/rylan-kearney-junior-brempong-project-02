// Phase 1: Recieving the results:

// a: Create a variable to store our form in --> query selector?
// b: Create a listner so we know when the user has submitted their choices
// c: prevent default()
// d: Store users choices in a variable
// e: Now that we've got our users selection in the form of a string, lets use it to target the appropriate array with the drinks objects
// f: Create a randomizer function for our drinks array --> this will produce one drink option in the form of a string 


// Phase 2: Make a call to the cocktail API (this will happen in the event listener function once the user submits)

// a: based off of the users drink option we have saved in the form of a string call the api to get back the image & title/header based on the users choice
// b: display those results to the page
    // b(a):add all the content we have dynamicallly created to the ul through its id name which already exists in the html
